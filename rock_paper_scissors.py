Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock - Terminal Game
------------------------------------------------

This Python program is a command-line implementation of the extended 
Rock Paper Scissors game made famous by "The Big Bang Theory." It includes 
support for five choices: rock, paper, scissors, lizard, and spock.

Features:
- Accepts both full and short-form user input (e.g., 'r' for rock, 'sc' for scissors)
- Tracks and displays player vs. computer results
- Declares a Grand Winner when a player reaches 5 wins
- Persists round history to a JSON file for long-term game tracking
- Offers options to view or clear saved game data
- Fully modular and lint-compliant, suitable for Launch School submissions
